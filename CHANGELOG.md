# Changelog

All notable changes to Argo are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — see
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for what that means concretely for this project, in
particular while the version stays `0.y.z`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

First formally tracked release. Argo has been under active development since 2026-06-18 (99
commits) without a real version/release process; rather than reconstruct that history after the
fact, this entry is a snapshot of what the pipeline can do today, and the changelog is precise from
here forward.

### Added

- Core pipeline: ingest → recon → audit → validate → report.
- Opt-in stages: deep verification (`deep_verify`), corroboration, second-opinion
  reconciliation across independent audit passes, dependency/SCA scanning, sandboxed
  runtime verification (loopback-only, `--network=none`), live authorized-target probing,
  mechanical fix generation + re-audit, and sandboxed AddressSanitizer/UBSan PoC generation
  for C/C++ memory-safety findings.
- Multi-backend support (Claude Code, Codex, local open-source models) with cross-backend
  fallback, failure-kind-aware retry/backoff, and a neutral-register recovery path for
  moderation-flagged sessions.
- HTTP API (`server/`) and a no-build web UI (`webapp/`) for run lifecycle, live status, and
  history.
- 388 tests, zero-token by default via a mock runner; a Docker-gated real end-to-end proof for
  the sandboxed stages.
